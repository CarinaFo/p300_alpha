# p300_alpha
"P300 is generated by alpha rhythm" accompanying code

This project uses Python 3.6.

----------------------------

p_compute_bsi.py - pipline for computation of baseline-shift indices (BSI) in sensor space

p_compute_bsi_in_source_space.py - pipline for computation of baseline-shift indices (BSI) in source space

p_read_erp_alpha_save.py - pipline for computation of saving ERs, alpha envelopes, and their trial-by-trial correlation in sensor space

p_save_covariance_apply_csp.py - pipeline for computation of covariance matries and CSP filter and pattern

p_source_reconstruction.py - pipline for computation of saving ERs, alpha envelopes, and their trial-by-trial correlation in source space

plot_simulated.py - pipeline for plotting using simulated data (without statistical assessment)

plots.py - pipeline for plotting fig. 1-8

simulations_fig_methods.py - simulates non-zero mean oscillations for figure in Methods section

tools_external.py - functions from other researchers

tools_general.py - functions for loading and saving files, and some statistics

tools_lifedataset.py - functions for handling LIFE data

tools_plotting.py - functions for plotting

tools_signal.py - functions for signal processing and data processing

----------------------------

Anonymized data will be made available upon request through the application procedure carried out by the LIFE-Study administration 
(https://www.uniklinikum-leipzig.de/einrichtungen/life).

----------------------------

Simulated data of two participants can be downloaded from https://osf.io/ak5de/.

To run pipelines using simulated data, the directories should be adjusted in settings/dir_files.
